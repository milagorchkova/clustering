Social behaviours in *Drosophila melanogaster* larvae are affected by natural variation in the *foraging* gene.

Studying genes involved in social behaviours can broaden our understanding of the evolution of sociality. We studied the effects of naturally occurring Rover and Sitter alleles of the *Drosophila melanogaster foraging* gene on cooperative foraging behaviour, in which larvae form organized groups known as clusters while feeding at high densities, allowing larval groups to dig deeper into the liquid layer of food. This phenotype may be adaptive under certain circumstances, and fitness advantages in adulthood have been demonstrated in flies that cluster as larvae. We found that Rovers and Sitters differ in the frequency with which they form clusters and that this differences was density dependent. At high larval densities sitters formed significantly more clusters than rovers but at low densities neither strain formed clusters. We used genetic alternations in the foraging gene to link cooperative larval foraging phenotypes to the *foraging* locus. The degree to which rovers and sitters liquified the top layer of food while feeding at high densities suggested the possibility of an extended phenotype. This was tested using transplantation experiments onto food pre-liquified by rover or sitter larvae. Future research will investigate how differences in the regulation of cooperative foraging behaviour in larvae are regulated and maintained in different social contexts. 

Methods

Pick 200 larvae from a grape plate over 4 hours after, clearing to control for age.

*foraging* null larvae are late pupal lethal and do not survive to adulthood, so the genetic mutant is balanced over a chromosome containing CyO-gfp. Null larvae are picked under UV light that causes the gfp-containing larvae to glow green. We selected the larvae that *do not* glow, as null/null homogzygous mutants do not have the balancer chromosome.

Incubate vials until 67 hours after egg hatching, and observe for clustering every 6 hours in daylight until 102 hrs aeh (start of wandering)

Measure liquified food layer from top of food (meniscus) to bottom of darker layer.
